# Infrastructure Layer

## Responsibility
The Infrastructure layer contains implementations of interfaces defined in outer layers. It handles technical details like databases, file systems, external APIs, and frameworks.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Implementation of Ports**: Concrete implementations of domain and application interfaces
- **Technical Details**: Handle database access, file storage, network communication
- **Framework Integration**: Integrate with external libraries and frameworks
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Implement technical aspects like logging, caching

## Key Components
- **Repositories**: Implement domain repository interfaces for data persistence
- **Services**: Implement application port interfaces for external system integration
- **Storage**: Handle file storage and retrieval operations
- **Network**: Manage API calls and external service communication

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement interfaces defined in domain and application layers
- Keep infrastructure concerns separate from business logic
- Use dependency injection to wire up implementations
- Handle technical exceptions and convert them to domain exceptions
- Optimize for performance and reliability

## Boundaries
- Depends on external libraries and frameworks
- Implements interfaces from domain and application layers
- Should not contain business logic
- Accessed through dependency injection
