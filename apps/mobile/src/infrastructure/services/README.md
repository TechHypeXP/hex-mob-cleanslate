# Infrastructure Services

## Responsibility
Infrastructure Services provide concrete implementations of application port interfaces. They handle integration with external systems and technical services.

## Architectural Purpose
- **External Integration**: Connect to external APIs, services, and systems
- **Technical Implementation**: Handle technical concerns like HTTP requests, file operations
- **Adapter Pattern**: Adapt external systems to application interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Convert external system errors to application exceptions

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement application port interfaces exactly
- Handle external system-specific concerns
- Convert external exceptions to domain or application exceptions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Optimize for performance and reliability

## Examples
```typescript
// Example service implementation (to be implemented)
class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationPort {
  constructor(private pushService: PushNotificationClient) {}
  
  async sendPushNotification(message: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

## Boundaries
- Infrastructure services belong to the infrastructure layer
- Implement application port interfaces
- Depend on external system clients and libraries
- Accessed through dependency injection
