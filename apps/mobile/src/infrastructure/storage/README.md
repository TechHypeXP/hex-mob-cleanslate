# Infrastructure Storage

## Responsibility
Storage components handle file storage and retrieval operations. They provide implementations for persisting and accessing binary data.

## Architectural Purpose
- **File Storage**: Store and retrieve files like photos, videos, and documents
- **Storage Abstraction**: Abstract different storage mechanisms (local, cloud, etc.)
- **Metadata Management**: Handle file metadata and indexing
- **Access Control**: Implement file access permissions and security

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement storage interfaces defined in application or domain layers
- Handle different storage backends (local filesystem, cloud storage)
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Optimize for performance and reliability
- Ensure data integrity and security

## Examples
```typescript
// Example storage implementation (to be implemented)
class PhotoStorageService {
  constructor(private storageClient: StorageClient) {}
  
  async uploadPhoto(file: File): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  async downloadPhoto(path: string): Promise<File> {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

## Boundaries
- Storage implementations belong to the infrastructure layer
- Implement storage interfaces from application or domain layers
- Depend on storage clients and libraries
- Accessed through dependency injection
