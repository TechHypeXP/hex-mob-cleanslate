# Infrastructure Network

## Responsibility
Network components handle communication with external APIs and services over the network. They manage HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, and other network protocols.

## Architectural Purpose
- **API Communication**: Handle REST API calls and GraphQL queries
- **Network Abstraction**: Abstract different network protocols and transports
- **Error Handling**: Manage network errors and timeouts
- **Security**: Implement network-level security measures

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement network interfaces defined in application or domain layers
- Handle different network protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling for network operations
- Optimize for performance and reliability
- Ensure data security during transmission

## Examples
```typescript
// Example network implementation (to be implemented)
class ApiService {
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}
  
  async fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<UserData> {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  async updateUserData(userData: UserData): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

## Boundaries
- Network implementations belong to the infrastructure layer
- Implement network interfaces from application or domain layers
- Depend on HTTP clients and network libraries
- Accessed through dependency injection
