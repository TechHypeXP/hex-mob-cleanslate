# Crosscutting Monitoring

## Responsibility
Monitoring components track application performance, health, and usage metrics. They provide insights into system behavior and help identify issues.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times, throughput, and resource usage
- **Health Checks**: Monitor system health and availability
- **Usage Analytics**: Collect usage patterns and user behavior data
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor application errors and exceptions

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement monitoring without impacting application performance
- Collect meaningful metrics that support business and technical decisions
- Implement proper sampling and aggregation for high-volume data
- Ensure monitoring data is secure and compliant with privacy regulations
- Provide dashboards and alerts for operational visibility

## Examples
```typescript
// Example monitoring usage
import { metrics } from './MetricsCollector';

metrics.increment('photo_upload_count');
metrics.timing('photo_upload_duration', uploadTime);
metrics.gauge('active_users', activeUserCount);
```

## Boundaries
- Monitoring belongs to the crosscutting layer
- Can be used by any layer of the application
- Should not contain business logic
- Accessed through dependency injection or monitoring services
