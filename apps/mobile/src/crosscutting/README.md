# Crosscutting Layer

## Responsibility
The Crosscutting layer contains concerns that span multiple layers of the application. These are technical concerns that support the overall system functionality.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Logging**: Implement application logging and monitoring
- **Validation**: Handle input validation and data integrity
- **Security**: Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Monitoring**: Provide performance monitoring and diagnostics

## Key Components
- **Logging**: Error logging, audit trails, and debug information
- **Validation**: Input validation, data sanitization, and business rule validation
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, health checks, and diagnostics

## Developer Guidelines
- Keep crosscutting concerns separate from business logic
- Implement consistent patterns across the application
- Use dependency injection for crosscutting services
- Handle crosscutting concerns at the appropriate layer boundaries
- Ensure crosscutting components are testable and configurable

## Boundaries
- Crosscutting components can be used by any layer
- Should not contain business logic
- Accessed through dependency injection or aspect-oriented programming
- Implemented as services or utilities that can be composed
