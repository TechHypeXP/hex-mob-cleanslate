# Crosscutting Security

## Responsibility
Security components handle authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security-related concerns. They protect the application and user data.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Authentication**: Verify user identity and manage sessions
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources and operations
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data and communications
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect and respond to security threats

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement security at multiple layers (network, application, data)
- Follow security best practices and standards
- Handle sensitive data with care (encryption, secure storage)
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Regularly update security measures and dependencies

## Examples
```typescript
// Example security usage
import { authService } from './AuthService';

const isAuthenticated = await authService.authenticate(credentials);
if (isAuthenticated) {
  const hasPermission = await authService.hasPermission('upload_photo');
  if (hasPermission) {
    // Proceed with secure operation
  }
}
```

## Boundaries
- Security belongs to the crosscutting layer
- Can be used by any layer of the application
- Should not contain business logic
- Accessed through dependency injection or security services
