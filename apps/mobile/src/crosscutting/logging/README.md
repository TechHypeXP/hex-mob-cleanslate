# Crosscutting Logging

## Responsibility
Logging components handle application logging, error tracking, and audit trails. They provide visibility into application behavior and issues.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and report application errors and exceptions
- **Audit Trails**: Record important business operations and user actions
- **Debug Information**: Provide detailed information for troubleshooting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Log performance metrics and bottlenecks

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement consistent logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Include contextual information in log messages
- Handle sensitive data appropriately (avoid logging PII)
- Implement structured logging for better analysis
- Ensure logging doesn't impact application performance

## Examples
```typescript
// Example logging usage
import { logger } from './Logger';

logger.info('User logged in', { userId: user.id });
logger.error('Failed to upload photo', { 
  userId: user.id, 
  photoId: photo.id, 
  error: error.message 
});
```

## Boundaries
- Logging belongs to the crosscutting layer
- Can be used by any layer of the application
- Should not contain business logic
- Accessed through dependency injection or static imports
