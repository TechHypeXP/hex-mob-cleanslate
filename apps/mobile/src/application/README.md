# Application Layer

## Responsibility
The Application layer orchestrates domain objects to implement use cases. It defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the domain layer objects to work out problems.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Use Case Implementation**: Contains application-specific business logic
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates domain objects to fulfill user requests
- **Transaction Management**: Defines transaction boundaries for operations
- **Security Enforcement**: Implements authorization checks

## Key Components
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific business logic (CQRS commands/queries)
- **Application Services**: Coordination services that don't fit in use cases
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define dependencies on external systems

## Developer Guidelines
- Keep application logic separate from domain logic
- Use cases should be focused and have a single responsibility
- Application services should coordinate domain objects, not contain business logic
- Implement CQRS pattern for clear separation of commands and queries
- Handle cross-cutting concerns like security and transactions

## Boundaries
- Depends on the domain layer
- Infrastructure layer implements application interfaces
- UI layer depends on this layer
- Should not depend on infrastructure details directly
