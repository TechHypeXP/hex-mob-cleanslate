# Domain Value Objects

## Responsibility
Value Objects are domain objects defined by their attributes rather than identity. They are immutable and can be shared.

## Architectural Purpose
- Represent descriptive aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity
- Ensure consistency and validity of attribute combinations
- Provide reusable, immutable domain concepts
- Reduce duplication of validation logic

## Developer Guidelines
- Make value objects immutable
- Implement equality based on attribute values
- Ensure value objects are valid upon creation
- Use value objects to encapsulate domain concepts that don't require identity
- Prefer value objects over primitive types for domain-specific attributes

## Examples
```typescript
// Example value objects (to be implemented)
class EmailAddress { /* ... */ }
class Location { /* ... */ }
class DateRange { /* ... */ }
```

## Boundaries
- Value objects belong to the domain layer
- Should not depend on infrastructure or UI concerns
- Can be used by entities and domain services
