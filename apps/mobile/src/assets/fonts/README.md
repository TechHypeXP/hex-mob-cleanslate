# Assets Fonts

## Responsibility
The Fonts directory contains custom typography resources used by the application to maintain consistent branding and visual identity.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Typography**: Provide custom fonts for consistent text styling
- **Branding**: Maintain brand-specific typography
- **Accessibility**: Support different text rendering requirements
- **Performance**: Optimize font loading and caching

## Developer Guidelines
- Use appropriate font formats (TTF, OTF) for cross-platform compatibility
- Optimize fonts for size and performance
- Implement proper font naming conventions
- Ensure fonts are properly licensed and attributed
- Test fonts across different devices and platforms

## Examples
```typescript
// Example font usage
import { loadAsync } from 'expo-font';

const loadFonts = async () => {
  await loadAsync({
    'Custom-Regular': require('../../assets/fonts/Custom-Regular.ttf'),
    'Custom-Bold': require('../../assets/fonts/Custom-Bold.ttf'),
  });
};
```

## Boundaries
- Fonts are consumed by the UI layer
- Should not contain executable code
- Accessed through font loading mechanisms
- Managed by build and deployment processes
