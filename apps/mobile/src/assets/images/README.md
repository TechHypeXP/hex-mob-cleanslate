# Assets Images

## Responsibility
The Images directory contains all bitmap graphics and icon resources used by the application.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Visual Elements**: Provide images for UI components and branding
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize image loading and caching
- **Resolution Support**: Provide assets for different screen densities
- **Accessibility**: Ensure images support accessibility features

## Developer Guidelines
- Use appropriate image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP) for different use cases
- Optimize images for size and quality
- Provide multiple resolutions for different screen densities
- Implement proper image naming conventions
- Ensure images are properly licensed and attributed

## Examples
```typescript
// Example image usage
import { require } from 'react-native';

const logo = require('../../assets/images/logo.png');
const placeholder = require('../../assets/images/placeholder.jpg');
```

## Boundaries
- Images are consumed by the UI layer
- Should not contain executable code
- Accessed through asset loading mechanisms
- Managed by build and deployment processes
