# Assets

## Responsibility
The Assets directory contains all static resources used by the application, including images, fonts, and animations.

## Architectural Purpose

- Use appropriate file formats and compression
- Implement proper asset naming conventions
- Optimize assets for performance and loading times
- Ensure assets are properly licensed and attributed

## Boundaries
- Assets are consumed by the UI layer
- Should not contain executable code
- Accessed through asset loading mechanisms
- Managed by build and deployment processes
