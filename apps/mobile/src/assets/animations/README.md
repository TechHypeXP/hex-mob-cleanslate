# Assets Animations

## Responsibility
The Animations directory contains motion graphics and animation resources used by the application to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback.

## Architectural Purpose
- **User Experience**: Enhance interactions with smooth animations
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide feedback for user actions and system states
- **Branding**: Maintain consistent animation style and branding
- **Performance**: Optimize animation performance and smoothness

## Developer Guidelines
- Use appropriate animation formats (Lottie, JSON) for cross-platform compatibility
- Optimize animations for performance and file size
- Implement proper animation naming conventions
- Ensure animations are properly licensed and attributed
- Test animations across different devices and platforms

## Examples
```typescript
// Example animation usage
import LottieView from 'lottie-react-native';

const LoadingAnimation = () => {
  return (
    <LottieView
      source={require('../../assets/animations/loading.json')}
      autoPlay
      loop
    />
  );
};
```

## Boundaries
- Animations are consumed by the UI layer
- Should not contain executable code
- Accessed through animation loading mechanisms
- Managed by build and deployment processes
