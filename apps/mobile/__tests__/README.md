# Tests

## Responsibility
The Tests directory contains all automated tests for the application, ensuring code quality, functionality, and reliability.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify that code functions as expected
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch issues introduced by changes
- **Documentation**: Serve as executable documentation of system behavior
- **Confidence**: Provide confidence in code changes and deployments

## Key Components
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components and systems
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows and scenarios

## Developer Guidelines
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths
- Use appropriate testing frameworks and tools
- Follow consistent naming and organization conventions
- Keep tests independent and deterministic

## Boundaries
- Tests validate the application layers (domain, application, infrastructure, UI)
- Should not contain production business logic
- Accessed through testing frameworks and CI/CD pipelines
- Managed by build and deployment processes
