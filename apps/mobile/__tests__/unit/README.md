# Unit Tests

## Responsibility
Unit tests verify the correctness of individual components, functions, and classes in isolation. They test the smallest testable parts of the application.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Functionality Verification**: Ensure individual units work as expected
- **Regression Detection**: Catch issues when code is modified
- **Design Feedback**: Provide feedback on code design and structure
- **Documentation**: Serve as executable documentation for unit behavior

## Developer Guidelines
- Test one unit of functionality per test case
- Keep tests fast and independent
- Use appropriate mocking and stubbing for dependencies
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Maintain high coverage for critical business logic

## Examples
```typescript
// Example unit test
import { PhotoModel } from '../../../src/domain/entities/PhotoModel';

describe('PhotoModel', () => {
  it('should toggle favorite status', () => {
    const photo = new PhotoModel('1', 'photo.jpg');
    expect(photo.isFavorite).toBe(false);
    
    photo.toggleFavorite();
    expect(photo.isFavorite).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Boundaries
- Unit tests focus on individual classes and functions
- Should mock external dependencies
- Run quickly and frequently during development
- Part of the overall test suite execution
