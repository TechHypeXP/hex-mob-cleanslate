# apps — Layer Doc (9-tier architecture)

Purpose
- What belongs in this tier; what problems it solves; strict boundaries. [docs on Expo/TS/Metro alias behavior for SDK≥50+ support referencing tsconfig paths][1][12][15]

Ownership & Boundaries
- Allowed imports: document per PRD.
- Forbidden imports: document per PRD.
- Cross-tier rules: document per PRD. [TS paths are resolved relative to baseUrl; Metro honors tsconfig paths in Expo SDK≥50 by default][7][1]

Folder Map
- Expected subfolders and file roles.

Public API (exports)
- What this layer exposes to others.

Alias & Resolution
- TS alias used here: document per PRD (e.g., @shared/*, @components/*).
- baseUrl context: apps/mobile uses baseUrl=./src; shared maps are absolute to repo root via relative paths. [Expo tsconfigPaths enabled by default; restart CLI after tsconfig changes][1][3][12][15]

Testing & Quality Gates
- Unit/integration/e2e scope for this tier; fixtures policy.

Security-by-Design
- Data flow constraints, no side-effects across boundaries, secrets policy.

Change Control
- Structure is set in stone; any change requires PRD-governed RFC.
