# Architecture Documentation

## Responsibility
The architecture directory contains documentation related to system architecture, design decisions, and technical specifications for the CleanSlate Mobile App.

## Architectural Purpose

- **Technical Decisions**: Record important technical decisions and rationale
- **Component Relationships**: Explain relationships between system components
- **Scalability Planning**: Document scalability and performance considerations

## Developer Guidelines
- Document major architectural decisions with context and rationale
- Keep architecture diagrams up-to-date
- Explain design patterns and their implementations
- Include performance and scalability considerations
- Review architecture documentation regularly

## Examples

## Boundaries
- Architecture documentation should focus on system-level concerns
- Keep documentation aligned with actual implementation
- Changes should reflect architectural modifications
- Part of the overall documentation structure
