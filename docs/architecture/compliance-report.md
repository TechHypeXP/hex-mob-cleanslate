## Compliance Status Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Folder Structure | âœ… COMPLIANT | All required directories created with proper hierarchy |
| Domain Models | âœ… VERIFIED | PhotoModel.ts and GamificationEntity.ts in correct locations |
| Documentation Coverage | âœ… 100% COMPLIANT | All directories have comprehensive README.md files |
| Central Documentation | âœ… COMPLETE | Architecture.md and compliance-report.md created |
| Overall Compliance | âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT | Structure matches DDD/Hexagonal Architecture specification |

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Structure**: Continue to follow the established folder structure for all future development
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep README.md files updated as implementations evolve
3. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review this compliance report to ensure continued adherence to architecture
4. **Domain Model Evolution**: As domain models become more complex, ensure they continue to follow DDD principles

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing concrete functionality within the established structure
2. Develop unit tests in the apps/mobile/__tests__/unit/ directory
3. Create integration tests as components are developed
4. Document any architectural decisions in docs/architecture/
