# Build Tools

## Responsibility
The build directory contains tools and scripts for building the CleanSlate Mobile App, including compilation, bundling, and optimization processes.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Compilation**: Compile source code to executable formats
- **Bundling**: Bundle application assets and dependencies
- **Optimization**: Optimize application performance and size
- **Build Automation**: Automate the build process

## Developer Guidelines
- Document all build scripts with clear usage instructions
- Keep build configurations organized and maintainable
- Test build scripts regularly to ensure they work correctly
- Optimize build processes for performance
- Review build documentation regularly

## Examples
```bash
# Example build script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Building application..."
npm run build

# Example optimization script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Optimizing assets..."
npm run optimize
```

## Boundaries
- Build tools should focus on compilation and bundling
- Keep build tools organized and well-documented
- Changes should reflect actual build process modifications
- Part of the overall tools structure
