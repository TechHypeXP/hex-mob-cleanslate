- Document all tools with clear usage instructions
- Write tools in a maintainable and reusable manner
- Test tools regularly to ensure they work correctly
- Review tool documentation regularly

## Structure
- **Build**: Tools and scripts for building the application
- **Deploy**: Tools and scripts for deployment processes
- **Scripts**: General-purpose development scripts and utilities

## Examples
```bash
# Example build script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Building application..."
npm run build

# Example deployment script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying application..."
npm run deploy
```

## Boundaries
- Tools should support development and deployment processes
- Keep tools organized and well-documented
