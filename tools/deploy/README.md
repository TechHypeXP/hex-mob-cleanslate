# Deployment Tools

## Responsibility
The deploy directory contains tools and scripts for deploying the CleanSlate Mobile App to various environments, including development, staging, and production.

## Architectural Purpose
- **Environment Deployment**: Deploy application to different environments
- **Release Management**: Manage release processes and versioning
- **Rollback Support**: Support rollback and recovery procedures
- **Deployment Automation**: Automate deployment processes

## Developer Guidelines
- Document all deployment scripts with clear usage instructions
- Keep deployment configurations organized by environment
- Test deployment scripts regularly to ensure they work correctly
- Implement proper error handling in deployment scripts
- Review deployment documentation regularly

## Examples
```bash
# Example deployment script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying to production..."
npm run deploy:prod

# Example rollback script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Rolling back to previous version..."
npm run rollback
```

## Boundaries
- Deployment tools should focus on environment deployment
- Keep deployment tools organized and well-documented
- Changes should reflect actual deployment process modifications
- Part of the overall tools structure
