# CleanSlate Mobile App UI Prototype (Legacy)

## Responsibility
The CleanSlate Mobile App UI Prototype directory contains the original UI prototype implementation of the CleanSlate Mobile App, built with web technologies for demonstration purposes.

## Architectural Purpose
- **UI Demonstration**: Demonstrate the original UI design and interactions
- **Prototype Validation**: Validate UI concepts and user flows
- **Design Reference**: Provide reference for the final mobile implementation
- **Technology Exploration**: Explore web-based UI technologies

## Developer Guidelines
- This is a legacy prototype and should not be actively developed
- Use this prototype for reference only
- Document any insights gained from the prototype
- Preserve the prototype for historical purposes
- Review prototype documentation for design context

## Structure
- **Components**: Original UI components implemented in React
- **Styles**: CSS styling and Tailwind configuration
- **Build Configuration**: Vite build configuration

## Examples
```typescript
// Example legacy component
import React from 'react';

const SwipeCard: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="swipe-card">
      <h2>Photo Title</h2>
      <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Boundaries
- This prototype should not be actively developed
- Keep the prototype preserved for reference
- Changes should only be made for critical fixes
